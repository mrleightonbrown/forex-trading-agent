# Decisions

Lightweight running log of technical decisions. Once a decision is significant
and stable enough to need a fuller record (context/options/consequences),
promote it to `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`.

## 2026-09-12 — Toolchain and dependency stack

**Decision:**

- Python 3.12, managed via `uv` (provisioned with `uv python install 3.12`,
  not the system/Homebrew Python).
- Package/dependency manager: `uv` (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`). Installed
  via the official standalone installer (`astral.sh/uv/install.sh`), not
  Homebrew — see note below.
- Web framework: FastAPI (per CLAUDE.md).
- Database: PostgreSQL, accessed via SQLAlchemy 2 async engine, driver
  `asyncpg`. Migrations via Alembic.
- HTTP client for the OANDA Practice API adapter: `httpx` (async).
- Config loading: `pydantic-settings`, one typed `Settings` object that
  validates `TRADING_MODE=PAPER`, `BROKER_ENVIRONMENT=PRACTICE`,
  `LIVE_TRADING_COMPILED=false` at startup and fails closed otherwise.
- Lint + format: Ruff (single tool, replaces Black/Flake8/isort).
- Type checking: mypy.
- Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, httpx `AsyncClient` for API
  tests.
- Local enforcement: pre-commit hooks (ruff lint, ruff format, mypy, basic
  hygiene, `detect-private-key`).
- CI: GitHub Actions — lint, type-check, pytest (with a Postgres service
  container) on push/PR.

**Why:** matches CLAUDE.md's fixed technologies (FastAPI, PostgreSQL,
SQLAlchemy 2, Alembic, Docker, pytest, OANDA Practice API) and fills the gaps
it deliberately leaves open. `uv` and Ruff chosen for speed and low
config-file overhead; async stack chosen throughout so the FastAPI app,
SQLAlchemy engine, and OANDA client share one concurrency model.

**Note on `uv` installation:** this machine is Intel x86_64 macOS, which
Homebrew stopped shipping prebuilt bottles for as of August 2025. `brew
install uv` falls back to building from source, which requires Xcode Command
Line Tools. Installed via `uv`'s own standalone installer script instead,
which ships a prebuilt binary — no compiler needed. Installed to
`~/.local/bin`, added to `PATH` via `~/.zprofile`.

## 2026-09-12 — FX-1: PostgreSQL primary key and timestamp conventions

**Decision:** every future table's primary key is a server-generated UUID
(`gen_random_uuid()`, requiring the `pgcrypto` extension), via a shared
`UUIDPrimaryKeyMixin`. Every table also gets `created_at`/`updated_at` as
`TIMESTAMPTZ`, populated server-side by Postgres, via a shared
`TimestampMixin`. Both live in
`forex_agent.infrastructure.db.mixins`.

**Why:** UUIDs avoid leaking row-count/ordering information (relevant for a
financial system) and need no coordination across services or replayed
backtests. Server-side, tz-aware timestamps directly enforce CLAUDE.md's
"All persisted timestamps use timezone-aware UTC values. Naive datetimes
must be rejected." — the column type is `TIMESTAMPTZ` and the value is never
supplied by application code, so a naive datetime can't reach the column in
the first place.

**Also recorded:** `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` /
`asyncio_default_test_loop_scope` are both set to `"session"` in
`pyproject.toml`. Without this, pytest-asyncio's default per-test-function
event loop breaks `get_engine()`'s cached singleton engine (correct in
production, where one event loop lives for the process's whole lifetime) —
its asyncpg connections stay bound to whichever loop created them, so the
next test's loop can't use them. A session-scoped test loop matches
production's actual loop lifetime.

## 2026-09-13 — FX-3: BrokerPort scoped to read-only, as a Protocol

**Decision:** `BrokerPort` (`application/ports/broker_port.py`) defines only
`get_price(instrument) -> Price` and `get_account_balance() -> Money`. No
order-placement/execution-intent method. Implemented as a `typing.Protocol`,
not an ABC.

**Why no order placement yet:** CLAUDE.md's current M0–M4 priority list
(items 1–11) stops at regime detection — Risk Engine, Decision Engine, and
Paper Trading Execution (Jira epics 10–12) are not part of the current
phase. CLAUDE.md is also explicit that no code may reach an order without
first going through risk approval and execution-intent creation, neither of
which exists yet. Adding a `place_order` method now would be a capability
with no safety mechanism behind it — easy for future code to call directly
and bypass the risk pipeline entirely by construction, simply because
nothing else exists yet to stop it. Add it deliberately when Risk
Engine/Paper Trading Execution is actually assigned, alongside whatever
execution-intent type gates it.

**Why `Protocol` over `ABC`:** structural typing means FX-4's real OANDA
adapter and any test double (`tests/fakes/broker_port.py`) only need to
match the method shapes, not inherit from a shared base. Verified working:
`FakeBrokerPort` satisfies `BrokerPort` under mypy with zero inheritance.

**Also established:** the domain-boundary contract-test pattern from FX-2
now has a shared helper (`tests/contract/_boundary.py`) and a second
instance guarding `application/` the same way
(`tests/contract/test_application_boundary.py`) — `application` may not
import FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/httpx/the OANDA SDK either, since
`infrastructure` depends on `application` (to implement its ports), never
the reverse.

## 2026-09-13 — FX-4: OANDA practice account access

**Decision:** created a personal OANDA fxTrade Practice account and a
personal access token (My Account → My Services → Manage API Access).
Credentials live only in the local, gitignored `.env` — never shared in
chat, never committed. Connectivity confirmed directly against
`GET /v3/accounts/{id}/summary` before any adapter code was written.

**Also confirmed against OANDA's own docs:** practice REST base URL
`https://api-fxpractice.oanda.com` (already in `.env.example` since FX-0);
live is `https://api-fxtrade.oanda.com`. OANDA returns balance/price fields
as JSON *strings*, so `OandaBrokerAdapter` converts straight to `Decimal`
from the string — never via `float`.

## 2026-09-13 — FX-4: OandaBrokerAdapter design

**Decision:** `OandaBrokerAdapter` takes `api_key`/`account_id`/`base_url`
as explicit constructor parameters (plus an optional injectable
`httpx.AsyncClient`) rather than reading `Settings` itself. The `apps`
composition root is responsible for pulling those three values out of
`Settings` when it wires the adapter up.

**Why:** keeps `infrastructure/broker_oanda` fully decoupled and trivially
testable in isolation (a mocked `httpx.AsyncClient` is enough — see
`tests/unit/infrastructure/broker_oanda/test_adapter.py`). Note this is a
mild inconsistency with FX-1's `infrastructure/db/session.py`, which *does*
import `apps.settings` directly for its process-lifetime singleton engine.
Not fixing that now — flagging it as a pre-existing wrinkle, not repeating
it here, since this adapter doesn't need a singleton the way the DB engine
does.

**Also decided:** the `Authorization` header is attached per-request
(`self._headers`, passed to every `.get()` call), not baked into the
client at construction time. This was forced by a real bug an early test
caught: when a test injects its own `httpx.AsyncClient` (as
`test_get_price_success` etc. do), a client-level default header set only
in the "adapter builds its own client" branch never reaches that injected
client, so the request left the auth header off entirely. Per-request
headers fixed it and are more correct regardless of test/production use.

**Also decided:** a defensive host check independent of `Settings`' own
PAPER/PRACTICE validation — `OandaBrokerAdapter` refuses to construct
against any host other than `api-fxpractice.oanda.com`
(`NonPracticeHostError`), since `OANDA_API_BASE_URL` is a separately
configurable value that could be pointed at the live host by mistake even
while `TRADING_MODE`/`BROKER_ENVIRONMENT` stay correct.

**Also decided:** the live integration test
(`tests/integration/test_oanda_broker_adapter.py`) auto-skips via
`pytest.mark.skipif` when `Settings.oanda_api_key`/`oanda_account_id` are
unset, so CI (which has no OANDA secrets) skips it cleanly rather than
failing, while a developer machine with `.env` populated runs it for real.
Adding OANDA secrets to GitHub Actions so CI exercises this too is a
reasonable future improvement, not done here.

## 2026-09-13 — FX-5: Candle domain primitive and persistence

**Decision:** `Candle` carries `bid: Ohlc` and `ask: Ohlc` (two full OHLC
sets), not a single mid-price OHLC. `Ohlc` validates that `high`/`low` are
actually the max/min of open-high-low-close, rejecting bad data before it
reaches storage. `Granularity` values match OANDA's own naming (`M1`,
`H4`, `D`, ...) — same reasoning as `Instrument.symbol` already matching
OANDA's instrument format, no translation table needed when FX-6 fetches
candles.

**Why bid+ask, not mid:** CLAUDE.md: "Backtests must include spread."
Collapsing to a single mid price at ingestion time would make that
impossible to recover later — the backtester (item 10) needs both sides
available from the start.

**Persistence:** `candles` table has a unique constraint on `(instrument,
granularity, start_time)`. `CandleRepository.upsert_many` (application
port) is implemented via Postgres `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` keyed on that
constraint — this is what makes re-running ingestion safe: the same
candle upserted twice produces one row, and a forming candle later
finalizing (same key, new values) updates in place rather than erroring or
duplicating. Verified by dedicated regression tests, since CLAUDE.md
explicitly calls out "duplicate events" and "provider duplication" as
required test coverage.

**Also decided:** the repository commits its own transaction inside
`upsert_many` rather than leaving commit control to a caller. Reasonable
for now since nothing yet composes multiple repository calls into one
transaction — FX-6's ingestion logic will just call this once per batch.
Worth reconsidering if a future story needs multi-repository atomicity.

**Also decided:** used `alembic revision --autogenerate` (previous
migrations were hand-written) now that a real ORM model exists to diff
against — reviewed the generated DDL before applying, per CLAUDE.md's
"review the diff" rule; only cosmetic changes made (docstring, import
order/formatting).

## 2026-09-13 — FX-6: MarketDataPort as a separate port; OANDA candle fetching

**Decision:** `MarketDataPort` (`get_candles`) is a new, separate `Protocol`
from `BrokerPort` (FX-3), not a method added to `BrokerPort`. Implemented
by `OandaMarketDataAdapter` against OANDA's
`/v3/instruments/{instrument}/candles`.

**Why separate from BrokerPort:** live quote/balance connectivity and
historical/bulk candle fetching are different shapes of concern (ranged,
potentially backfill-heavy) even though one provider (OANDA) implements
both for now. Confirmed live that this endpoint needs no account ID at
all, unlike `BrokerPort`'s two methods — a further sign it's a genuinely
different capability, not an extension of the same one.

**Confirmed live against the practice API before writing any adapter
code** (same discipline as FX-4):
- The endpoint takes no account ID — just `granularity`/`from`/`to`/`price`.
- Its `time` field (nanosecond-precision, e.g.
  `"2026-09-11T20:57:00.000000000Z"`) parses directly with Python 3.12's
  `datetime.fromisoformat` — no manual truncation/reformatting needed.
- OANDA caps `count` at 5000 and returns HTTP 400
  (`"Maximum value for 'count' exceeded"`) for a `from`/`to` range
  implying more, rather than silently truncating the response. Confirmed
  the distinct error text for an invalid instrument
  (`"Invalid value specified for 'instrument'"`) so the adapter can tell
  the two 400 cases apart and raise the right exception for each.

**Decision:** `get_candles` is bounded to one request and raises
`CandleRangeTooLargeError` if the range would exceed OANDA's cap, rather
than silently truncating or auto-paginating. Pagination for backfills
larger than 5000 candles at a given granularity is explicit future work,
not built here — keeps this story to one coherent piece.

**Decision:** ingestion stores every candle OANDA returns, finalized or
not. A still-forming candle gets `is_finalized=False` and updates in place
once OANDA later reports it complete, via FX-5's upsert-on-conflict.
CLAUDE.md's "strategies must only evaluate finalized candles" is a filter
applied when *reading* candles later, not a reason to withhold forming
ones from storage now.

**Decision:** reused FX-3's `BrokerPortError` hierarchy (adding one new
member, `CandleRangeTooLargeError`) rather than a parallel hierarchy for
`MarketDataPort` — same failure shapes. Renamed the module docstring to
reflect both ports use it. Worth revisiting the "Broker" naming if a
third, differently-shaped port ever needs its own failure modes.

**Also decided:** extracted `OandaBrokerAdapter` and `OandaMarketDataAdapter`'s
shared plumbing (the practice-host guard, JSON parsing/error-message
extraction) into `infrastructure/broker_oanda/_shared.py` rather than
duplicating it in the new adapter — refactored `OandaBrokerAdapter` to use
it too; all 19 of its existing tests still pass unchanged.
